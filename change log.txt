	1. Update the code's developers list
Date 17-07-2020
	1. fixed the bug in for recSize length computation in funciton UDW2p_setUp
		recSize = ( Nx * 2 + Np * 2 )
	2. Only use the first 7/8 of the modes to re-construct the velocity 

Date 02-Jun-2020
	1. Add  HOS-NWT Support. The HOS-NWT support has the following limitations
		1. The domain need the same as HOS-NWT
		2. The number of nx grid need the same as HOS-NWT
		The limitation is due to the computation of velocity at the free has problem when 
			wave propgate to the viscous zone.The velocity is not correct.

	1. change the software to HOS in the description file.
	2. normalzied the UDW2P data by water depth (h) and gravity (g)
		length : normalzied by water depth h
		time   : normalzied by sqrt(h/g)
		velocity: normalzied by sqrt(h*g)
